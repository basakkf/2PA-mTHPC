# Two-Photon Antenna Conjugated mTHPC ‚Äì PDB Files Dataset

This repository contains PDB structure files of two-photon antenna conjugated temoporfin (mTHPC) molecules modeled in different biological environments: **water**, **membrane**, and **cyclodextrin complex**. These structures support the findings presented in the scientific publication:

**"Rational Molecular Design of Two-Photon Activated Temoporfin: A Computational Study for Advanced Photodynamic Therapy"**

## üß™ Description

Temoporfin (mTHPC) is a photosensitizer used in photodynamic therapy. In this work, mTHPC was conjugated with various two-photon absorbing antenna to enhance its activation efficiency under near-infrared light. The structures provided here were used in molecular simulations to investigate behavior and interactions in:

- Aqueous environment (water)
- Lipid bilayer membrane
- Cyclodextrin inclusion complex

These conformations were optimized and validated through computational chemistry techniques, aiding in the rational design of more effective photosensitizers.
